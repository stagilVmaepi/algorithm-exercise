## What is Total Tank Simulator?
 
Total Tank Simulator is a game that simulates realistic WWII battles with hundreds of units on large maps. You can play as one of six factions: Germany, USSR, USA, UK, France, or Italy. Each faction has its own units, weapons, vehicles, planes, and special abilities. You can also customize your army with different skins and flags.
 
The game has three main modes: Sandbox, Campaign, and Shadow. In Sandbox mode, you can create your own scenarios and experiment with different settings and parameters. In Campaign mode, you can follow the historical events of WWII and complete various missions. In Shadow mode, you can play as a single unit and fight alongside your army or against it.
 
The game also supports Steam Workshop, where you can download and share user-generated content such as maps, units, scenarios, and mods. You can also join the official Discord server to chat with other players and developers.
  
## Why Download Total Tank Simulator Demo 4?
 
If you are interested in Total Tank Simulator but not sure if you want to buy it, you might want to try the demo first. However, the current demo available on Steam is Demo 5, which is a limited version of the game that only has one faction (Germany), one map (Normandy), and one mode (Sandbox).
 
Demo 4 is an older version of the game that was released in 2019. It has more features and content than Demo 5, such as four factions (Germany, USSR, USA, UK), four maps (Normandy, Africa, Winterland, Desert), and two modes (Sandbox and Shadow). It also has more units and vehicles to choose from, such as tanks, infantry, planes, artillery, and more.
 
Demo 4 is not perfect though. It has some bugs and glitches that might affect your gameplay experience. It also does not reflect the current state of the game or its future updates and DLCs. For example, it does not have France or Italy as playable factions, or Japan as a DLC faction. It also does not have the Campaign mode or the Steam Workshop support.
 
Therefore, if you want to get a taste of Total Tank Simulator's gameplay and features without buying it yet, you might want to download Demo 4 instead of Demo 5. However, if you want to play the latest version of the game with more content and improvements, you might want to buy it on Steam or wait for future updates and DLCs.
